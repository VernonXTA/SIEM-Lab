# Home SIEM Lab

Welcome to my home SIEM lab! This repository contains screenshots and details of the lab I’m currently configuring and experimenting with.

## Overview
In this project, I’m focusing on **blue teaming**—the defense side of cybersecurity, which I believe is one of the most critical roles in any organization. Below, you'll find examples of various activities detected and monitored by my lab setup.

## Key Highlights
- The **bar graphs** in the screenshots represent detected activity within the lab environment, categorized by specific conditions or events.
- For instance, one screenshot showcases how **'nmap' scanners** were identified on the network and reported to the SIEM for further analysis.
- Another image reveals the **commands** used by an "attacker," showing detailed insights into the intrusion attempt, including the origin of the attack.

I am continuously tweaking and enhancing this setup to further hone my blue team skills. Stay tuned for updates as I add more features and configurations!
